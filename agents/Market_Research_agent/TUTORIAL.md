## Introduction: What is an AI Agent? {#introduction}

### What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is an autonomous program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Think of it as a digital assistant that doesn't just respond to questions—it actively works to complete tasks.

**Key Characteristics of AI Agents:**
- **Autonomy**: Can operate independently without constant human intervention
- **Goal-Oriented**: Works towards specific objectives
- **Reactive**: Responds to changes in the environment
- **Proactive**: Takes initiative to achieve goals
- **Tool-Using**: Can interact with external systems and APIs

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a research assistant who:
1. Understands your research topic
2. Generates relevant questions to explore
3. Searches multiple sources (Google, academic databases, etc.)
4. Analyzes and synthesizes information
5. Compiles findings into a professional report

That's exactly what our Market Research Agent does—but it's automated and works at superhuman speed!

### Why Build an AI Agent?

Traditional chatbots answer questions. AI agents **solve problems**. They can:
- Break down complex tasks into steps
- Use multiple tools and APIs
- Make decisions based on context
- Learn from interactions
- Complete entire workflows autonomously

---

## Understanding the Frameworks {#frameworks}

Before we dive into building, let's understand the tools we'll use:

### 1. **Agno Framework** - The Agent Orchestrator

**What is Agno?**
Agno is a Python framework specifically designed for building AI agents. It provides a clean, intuitive way to create agents that can reason, use tools, and interact with language models.

**Why Agno?**
- **Simple API**: Easy to understand and use
- **Agent-Centric**: Built specifically for agent workflows
- **Flexible**: Works with multiple LLM providers
- **Tool Integration**: Makes it easy to connect external APIs

**Key Agno Concepts:**
- **Agent**: The main entity that processes tasks
- **Model**: The language model (like GPT-4) that powers the agent
- **Instructions**: System prompts that guide agent behavior
- **Run**: Executing an agent with input to get output

### 2. **OpenAI API** - The Brain

**What is OpenAI?**
OpenAI provides access to powerful language models like GPT-4, which serve as the "brain" of our agent. These models understand context, generate text, and reason about complex topics.

**Why OpenAI?**
- **State-of-the-Art**: GPT-4 is one of the most capable models available

---

## Step-by-Step Build Process {#step-by-step}

### Step 1: Environment Setup

**1.1 Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir market-research-agent
cd market-research-agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Or on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Why Virtual Environments?**
Virtual environments isolate your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects. It's like having a separate toolbox for each project.

**1.2 Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install agno>=2.2.10 streamlit openai requests reportlab python-dotenv
```

**What Each Package Does:**
- `agno`: Agent framework
- `streamlit`: Web UI framework
- `openai`: OpenAI API client
- `requests`: HTTP library for API calls
- `reportlab`: PDF generation
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management

### Step 2: Project Structure

Create the following structure:
```
market-research-agent/
├── app.py              # Main application file
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
├── .env               # API keys (not in git)
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

### Step 3: Understanding Agent Architecture

Our agent has three main components:

#### 3.1 Question Generator Agent
**Purpose**: Breaks down research topics into specific questions

**How It Works:**
1. Takes topic and domain as input
2. Uses GPT-4 to generate research questions
3. Returns a list of questions (3-10, customizable)
4. Supports different question types (yes/no, open-ended, comparative, analytical)

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Model**: GPT-4 (via OpenAI)
- **Instructions**: "You are an expert at breaking down research topics into specific questions"
- **Input**: Topic and domain
- **Output**: Numbered list of questions

#### 3.2 Research Agent
**Purpose**: Answers each research question using multiple sources

**How It Works:**
1. Takes a research question as input
2. Searches SerpApi (Google) for relevant information
3. Optionally searches Perplexity for additional insights
4. Combines search results
5. Uses GPT-4 to synthesize an answer
6. Returns answer with source citations

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Instructions**: "You are a sophisticated research assistant. Answer the research question using the provided search results."
- **Input**: Question + search results
- **Output**: Comprehensive answer with citations

#### 3.3 Report Compiler Agent
**Purpose**: Synthesizes all research findings into a professional report

**How It Works:**
1. Takes all question-answer pairs as input
2. Uses GPT-4 to structure findings
3. Creates executive summary, analysis sections, and conclusion
4. Formats as professional HTML report
5. Includes citations and references

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Instructions**: "Compile research findings into a professional, McKinsey-style report"
- **Input**: All Q&A pairs + sources
- **Output**: Structured HTML report

### Step 4: Building the Question Generator

**Concept**: The question generator is our first agent. It demonstrates the core Agno pattern:

1. **Create an Agent**: Define name, model, and instructions
2. **Run the Agent**: Pass input and get output
3. **Process Output**: Extract and format the results

**Key Agno Pattern:**
```python
# Pseudocode structure
agent = Agent(
    name="Question Generator",
    model=llm,
    instructions="Your instructions here"
)

result = agent.run(input="Your input here")
output = result.content
```

**Why This Pattern Works:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Agents can be reused with different inputs
- **Testability**: Easy to test individual agents
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents

### Step 5: Building the Research Function

**Concept**: Research involves multiple steps that must be coordinated:

1. **Search Phase**: Query external APIs
2. **Synthesis Phase**: Use LLM to analyze results
3. **Citation Phase**: Track and format sources

**Parallel Processing:**
Instead of researching questions one-by-one (slow), we research all questions simultaneously (fast). This uses Python's `asyncio` library.

**Why Parallel Processing Matters:**
- **Speed**: 5 questions in ~3 minutes instead of ~15 minutes
- **Efficiency**: Better resource utilization
- **User Experience**: Faster results

**Async Pattern:**
```python
# Pseudocode
async def research_question(question):
    # Search APIs
    # Synthesize with LLM
    return answer

# Research all questions in parallel
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    research_question(q) for q in questions
])
```

### Step 6: Building the Report Compiler

**Concept**: The report compiler demonstrates advanced agent usage:

1. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Agent must understand all research findings
2. **Structured Output**: Must follow specific format (executive summary, analysis, conclusion)
3. **Citation Management**: Must properly attribute sources

**Why a Separate Compiler Agent?**
- **Specialization**: Different instructions for different tasks
- **Quality**: Focused agents produce better output
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify report format without affecting research

### Step 7: Building the User Interface

**Streamlit Components We Use:**

1. **Sidebar**: API key inputs and configuration
2. **Main Area**: Research topic inputs
3. **Settings Panel**: Question count and type selection
4. **Results Display**: Expandable sections for each question
5. **Export Buttons**: Download reports in different formats

**Streamlit Pattern:**
```python
# Input
topic = st.text_input("Research Topic")

# Button
if st.button("Start Research"):
    # Process
    results = do_research(topic)
    # Display
    st.write(results)
```

**Why This UI Works:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Shows information as needed
- **Clear Workflow**: Step-by-step process is obvious
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Progress indicators and status messages
- **Export Options**: Easy to save results

### Step 8: Adding Error Handling and Timeouts

**Why Timeouts Matter:**
- **API Reliability**: External APIs can be slow or fail
- **User Experience**: Prevents indefinite waiting
- **Resource Management**: Frees up resources if something hangs

**Our Timeout Strategy:**
- **SerpApi**: 20-second timeout
- **Perplexity**: 20-second timeout
- **Agent Runs**: 90-second timeout

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```python
try:
    result = api_call(timeout=20)
except TimeoutError:
    # Fallback or skip
    result = None
except Exception as e:
    # Log and continue
    st.warning(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Key Concepts Explained {#concepts}

### 1. Agent Instructions (System Prompts)

**What Are They?**
Instructions are the "personality" and "expertise" of your agent. They tell the LLM how to behave and what role to play.

**Example:**
```
"You are a sophisticated research assistant. Answer research questions 
using provided search results. Include citations with URLs when 
referencing sources."
```

**Why They Matter:**
- **Consistency**: Ensures agent behaves predictably
- **Quality**: Better instructions = better output
- **Specialization**: Different instructions for different tasks

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific about the task
- Define the output format
- Include examples when helpful
- Set tone and style expectations

### 2. Agent Orchestration

**What Is It?**
Orchestration is coordinating multiple agents to complete a complex task.

**Our Orchestration Flow:**
```
User Input
    ↓
Question Generator Agent
    ↓
[Question 1, Question 2, ..., Question N]
    ↓
Research Agents (Parallel)
    ↓
[Answer 1, Answer 2, ..., Answer N]
    ↓
Report Compiler Agent
    ↓
Final Report
```

**Why Orchestration Matters:**
- **Complexity Management**: Break complex tasks into simpler ones
- **Parallelization**: Do multiple things at once
- **Modularity**: Easy to modify individual steps
- **Debugging**: Easier to find issues in specific agents

### 3. Tool Integration

**What Are Tools?**
Tools are external services or functions that agents can use. In our case:
- SerpApi (search tool)
- Perplexity (search tool)
- ReportLab (PDF generation tool)

**How Agents Use Tools:**
1. Agent receives input
2. Agent decides which tools to use
3. Agent calls tools with appropriate parameters
4. Agent processes tool results
5. Agent generates final output

**Tool Integration Pattern:**
```python
# Search tool
def search_serpapi(query):
    response = requests.get(serpapi_url, params={'q': query})
    return response.json()

# Agent uses tool
search_results = search_serpapi(question)
agent_input = f"Question: {question}\n\nSearch Results: {search_results}"
answer = agent.run(agent_input)
```

### 4. Asynchronous Processing

**What Is Async?**
Asynchronous processing allows multiple operations to run concurrently instead of sequentially.

**Sequential (Slow):**
```
Question 1: Research → 2 minutes
Question 2: Research → 2 minutes
Question 3: Research → 2 minutes
Total: 6 minutes
```

**Parallel (Fast):**
```
Question 1, 2, 3: Research simultaneously → 2 minutes
Total: 2 minutes
```

**How We Implement It:**
```python
# Create tasks for all questions
tasks = [research_question(q) for q in questions]

# Execute all tasks concurrently
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**Why It Matters:**
- **Speed**: 3x faster for 3 questions
- **Scalability**: Handles more questions efficiently
- **User Experience**: Faster results

### 5. State Management

**What Is State?**
State is the data your application remembers between interactions.

**Our State Variables:**
- `questions`: Generated research questions
- `question_answers`: Answers to each question
- `question_sources`: Sources for each answer
- `report_content`: Final compiled report
- `research_history`: Previous research sessions

**Why State Matters:**
- **Persistence**: Remembers user inputs and results
- **Workflow**: Enables multi-step processes
- **History**: Allows reloading previous work

**Streamlit State Pattern:**
```python
# Initialize state
if 'questions' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.questions = []

# Update state
st.session_state.questions = new_questions

# Use state
for q in st.session_state.questions:
    st.write(q)
```
